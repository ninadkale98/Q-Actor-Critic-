in critic loss -> detached exp exp.detach()
learning rate = 0.00001 from 0.0001

----------------------------------------------------------
I got MSE returned NAN. some values are going to inf ig. 

smith too did exp detach and it make sense to have it. learning rate is fine too. 

i have not used negative in log prop * tderr equation

let it train for 10k episodes

---------------------------------------------------------



tring with negative in logprop * tderr -> only change

----------------------------------------------------------

i can try with different learning rate of acotr and critic

this configuration looks much better than previous ones. keep it and change other parameters

(exp - q).pow(2).mean() -> check this 

smitr is saying dont use sum. just 

try lunar lander 


--------------------------------------------
removed  exp detached
for terminal state newQsa is zero

--------------------------------------------------------------------

changed order of calling zero_grad and loss
using nn.MSE loss
removed retain_graph=True as it is independent
